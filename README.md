This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# How I meet or exceed the creteria
I have extensive experience building high-performing web applications using REST APIs, particularly with Laravel, NextJS, and ReactJS. Two of my personal projects, senza.co.zw and adfury.co.zw, demonstrate my proficiency in implementing SSR to ensure fast loading times and improve SEO. Senza, for example, scores 100% on Performance & SEO, and at least 92% on Accessibility and Best Practices, while AdFury achieves at least 95% in each Lighthouse category. I am also skilled in optimizing database queries with Laravel and automating testing and deployment pipelines using various technologies such as Cypress, Dusk, PHPUnit, Pest, deployer, Jenkins, Ansible, and GitHub workflows.

My curious mindset drives me to tackle challenging problems and constantly seek innovative ways to optimize everything within my purview. While I always strive for perfection, I understand the importance of balancing business needs with technical excellence, and I am comfortable making pragmatic decisions when necessary. Overall, I am confident that I meet or exceed the expectations listed for this position.

# Why am excited
While I may not have a specific passion for classic cars, I am still very interested in the automotive industry as a whole and am always willing to learn as much as I can about different types of cars. I have even considered taking a mechanic course in the past to deepen my knowledge in this area. What excites me about this role in particular is the opportunity to work with a team of experts in the field and to gain valuable experience in a niche market. I believe that the skills and knowledge I bring from my previous experience in web development and project management, combined with my willingness to learn about classic cars, will allow me to contribute to the team at Car & Classic and grow in my own career at the same time.
